## The Situation

Creat dashboard that only looked into the attrition in the organization.

## Project Situation

The dataset might be need a bit cleaning, push it into power query and having it cleaned and transformed.

###  Insight needed in the dashboard :

- Categorize enplyees dictances from home into (Far-away, Far and very Far):
- Break the emplyees work years into groups with interval of 10 years.
- Transaform the job satisfaction from number (1,2,3,..) to something more readable.
- Creat an age-bucket for the emplyees (age column).
-Show necessary KPI in your dashboard.

### Steps followed :

- Step 01 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a excel file.
- Step 02 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 03 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".



Following DAX expression was written for the dashboard
- Measure 01 : New measure was created to find total count of emplyees.

        Total Employees = COUNTROWS(FTable)

- Measure 02  : Total Attrition:

        Total Attrition = 
        CALCULATE([Total Employees,
        FTable[Attrition]= "Yes"
        )

Measure 03  : Total Attrition % :

        Attrition % = DIVIDE([Total Attrition],[Total Employees],0)

- Measure 04  : Total Male Attrition:

        Male Attrition = 
        CALCULATE(
        [Total Attrition],
        FTable[Gender]="Male"
        )
- Measure 04 : Total Female Attrition:

        Male Attrition =

        Male Attrition % = DIVIDE([Male Attrition],[Total Attrition],0)
